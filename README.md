# Demo Jekyll site

To build, install Jekyll and run "bundle exec jekyll build". The result will end up in _site (or push this to GitHub Pages or Netlify).

Change the layout (overall HTML) in _layouts/page.html.

To make new pages on the website, create new files in this directory ending in .html modeled after index.html or buy.html.
